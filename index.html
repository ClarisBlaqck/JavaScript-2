    <h2>Functions Introduction</h2>
    <h4>Excersise 1</h4>
    <p>
        The previous chapter introduced the standard function Math.min that
        returns its smallest argument. We can build something like that now.
        Write a function min that takes two arguments and returns their minimum.
    </p>
    <h4>Excersise 2</h4>
    <p>
        We’ve seen that % (the remainder operator) can be used to test whether
a number is even or odd by using % 2 to see whether it’s divisible by
two. Here’s another way to define whether a positive whole number is
even or odd:
        <ul>
            <li>Zero is even.</li>
            <li>One is odd.</li>
            <li>For any other number N, its evenness is the same as N - 2.</li>
        </ul>
Define a recursive function isEven corresponding to this description.
The function should accept a single parameter (a positive, whole number)
and return a Boolean.<br>
Test it on 50 and 75. See how it behaves on -1. Why? Can you think
of a way to fix this?
    </p>
    <h4>Excersise 3</h4>
    <p>
        You can get the Nth character, or letter, from a string by writing "string
"[N]. The returned value will be a string containing only one character
(for example, "b"). The first character has position 0, which causes the
last one to be found at position string.length - 1. In other words, a
two-character string has length 2, and its characters have positions 0
and 1.
Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only argument and
returns a number that indicates how many uppercase “B” characters
there are in the string.
Next, write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs,
except it takes a second argument that indicates the character that is
to be counted (rather than counting only uppercase “B” characters).
Rewrite countBs to make use of this new function.
